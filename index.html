<h3><em>Music.</em></h3>

<p>Most of the people nowadays can’t imagine their life without music. Some use it more, some less, also in different situations, but a lot of us can’t imagine our week without some music in it at some point. Regardless of the context in space or time, this simple word can evoke millions of melodies, rythms, artists, that have influenced our lives. Music accompanies us all our life, shapes and embellishes our best memories.</p>

<p>We are very passionate about music and we want to share our enthusiasm with our visualization project “Evolution of Rock Music”, based on the widely used dataset “Million songs”.</p>

<p>Why Rock Music ?</p>

<p>First of all, rock music was a uninanimous choice in terms of music taste in our team, so it’s only natural to choose the genre that suits us the best. We were really motivated to know more about the subgenres we like the most and also to expand our music knowledge by discovering other styles ! 
Secondly, we want to reach the maximum of audience with our visualization, which is meant to be easily understood and instructive. Rock with its many subgenres and fusions, covers a large scope of the music produced in the western countries for the past 70 years and we believe that everyone knows at least some songs from iconic artists and groups like Elvis Presley, The Beatles or Michael Jackson.</p>

<p>So, let’s ROCK!</p>

<p>Our visualization starts in 1956. Rock music starts in 1950s with Rock'n'Roll (something we can see straight away from the streamgraph on the visualization) and it started in the US. If we zoom more on the map, we can find Little Richard, who is an American musician, song writer and singer who laid the foundation for rock and roll.  With his screaming and blazing clothes he was brought unparalleled energy and good vibes. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the 60s we notice that Rock music starts to spreads all over America, but also in the UK. It’s a style of music that first touched English speaking countries. There is a rise of 3 genres: Blues Rock, Pop Rock and Soft rock </p>
